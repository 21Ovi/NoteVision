# NoteVision

**NoteVision** is a handwriting recognition project designed to convert handwritten notes into digital text using machine learning models. This repository contains the core Google Colab notebooks used for training, testing, and validating the model, along with the final trained model for deployment or further usage.

## Tech Stack:

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **Python**: The programming language for all scripts and model development.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: A large dataset of handwritten names used for training the model.
- **Google Colab**: The workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is documented and executed in Google Colab notebooks.

The focus of this repository is on providing clean, documented notebooks and the final model. No other dependencies or extra modules are included.
